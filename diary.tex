\record{razzaghi2013efficient}{7/8/2020}
Fault event can be described as an injection in the power system in a step-like wave. Reflection coefficients, $\rho$, whose values depend on the line surge and input impedance are used. It is a step-by-step process where the fault location is guessed (and the fault impedance is apriori information), and the time-reversal approach is applied using the recorded voltages. Corresponding values of the fault currents are recorded at each guessed fault location. The fault current signal energy is calculated for all the guessed fault location, $\Gamma = \sum_{j=1}^N i^2_{x_f}(j^2)$. The maximum of the fault energies corresponds to the estimated location of the faults.
\chapter{Example Chapter}

\record{einstein1935can}{27/06/2020}
I can write a summary of the paper here. I can write multiple paragraphs as follows. \par
The title of this page is the BibTeX key. The title itself is hyperlinked to the PDF of the paper. If the link does not work check the folder structure is consistent and perhaps try with a different PDF viewer (it works in Evince document viewer). When it comes time to cite this paper, I can quickly copy the BibTeX key into my LaTeX file without rummaging through the references.bib file. \par
Also note the bibliography entry is displayed above so that I can check the fields in the references.bib file have been entered properly. Since it contains indexable information (e.g. title, authors, year of publication, journal, etc.) we can use the search feature of the PDF viewer to find specific papers. \par
Each summary begins on a new page and the header also displays the BibTeX key on the left. On the right is the date that I read the paper. There is full control over the order the summaries are displayed by moving them around in the reading.tex file. I like to have a reverse chronological order since what I read recently is at the top. \par
Each paper can be assigned to a chapter for easy sorting. At the moment it is not possible to add a paper into two chapters simultaneously so I just choose the most appropriate chapter. Later on, I might make a HTML interface that allows assigning tags to each summary to make sorting more practical. \par
Since this a LaTeX document, it is quite easy to enter math mode to write equations, for example:
$$
\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1
$$
It is also possible to have tables and even draw diagrams using TikZ.
